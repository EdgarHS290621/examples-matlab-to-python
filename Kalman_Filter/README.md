# Kalman Filter Example (MATLAB to Python)

This project demonstrates the conversion of a basic 1D Kalman Filter algorithm from MATLAB to Python.

The Kalman Filter estimates the true state of a system over time, correcting noisy measurements.  
This simple version assumes constant process and measurement noise and is ideal for introductory applications in time-series filtering.
