This repository showcases examples of translating simple but representative MATLAB scripts into clean, modular Python code.

Each example demonstrates not only direct translation but also good coding practices such as modularization, testing, and documentation.

## Examples

### 1. Kalman Filter (1D)
- Estimate a hidden true value from noisy measurements using a simple Kalman filter.
- Demonstrates time-series filtering and state estimation.

### 2. Moving Average Filter
- Smooth a financial time series using a simple moving average.
- Demonstrates basic signal smoothing.

### 3. AR(1) Process Simulation
- Simulate a simple autoregressive process AR(1) to model a financial asset price over time.
- Demonstrates stochastic processes and random noise modeling.
